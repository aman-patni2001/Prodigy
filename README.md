# Prodigy
This project named ‘Prodigy’ is a ‘Movie review site’ which is meant for all operating systems. 
The main purpose of this website is to reach out to the people who watch movies very often. 
This portal aims at providing all information related to the movies at one place to the user.
It gives an overview of the movie along with it's rating and the functionalities provide users with similar movies to the searched movie.

I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make this web page. API is used to fetch information about the movies from the site – themoviedb.org. 
It requires a text editor and compiler like VSCode or Sublime Text to develop/code the webpage.

A summary of the major functions that the portal will perform:
      • The page contains a search interface in which we can search the movie of our choice using key words. Searched movie along with similar movies is then displayed. 
      • The webpage contains movies displayed in grid layout. 
      • On hovering over a movie, the user gets movie description and rating.
